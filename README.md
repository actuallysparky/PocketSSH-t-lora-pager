# PocketSSH T-Lora Pager Variant

This repository is a focused fork of the original PocketSSH project:

- Source project: https://github.com/0015/PocketSSH
- Original authors and project maintainers retain full credit for PocketSSH.

This variant focuses on the LilyGO T-Lora Pager / T-Pager hardware and its related UX improvements.
Current enhancement milestones in this fork:
- T-Pager hardware bring-up and firmware packaging.
- `ssh_config` host alias parsing (`/sdcard/ssh_keys/ssh_config`) with `connect <alias>` and `hosts` commands.

For full project features, documentation, and history, see the upstream repository above.
